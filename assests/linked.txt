ðŸš€ Excited to Share My Latest Project! ðŸš€

As part of my HTML and CSS learning journey, I recently created clones of Zomato and Myntra! ðŸŽ‰

Throughout this process, I've enhanced my skills in web development, focusing on:

Learning and applying responsive design principles
Effective use of HTML structure and semantics
Building these projects from scratch allowed me to better understand the intricacies of front-end development and gave me the confidence to tackle more complex challenges in the future.

Check out the screenshots of my projects below! ðŸ‘‡

ðŸŒŸ A huge shoutout to all the resources and mentors who guided me along the way. Your support has been invaluable!

Looking forward to diving deeper into web development and taking on new challenges. Feel free to connect with me to discuss all things tech and coding!
